# Mission-to-Mars
DU Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 10: Web-scraping, MongoDB, and more Flask

## Overview of Project
Building upon the implementation of using NoSQL databases (MongoDB) to hold information, we branched this week into using this database to store information from WebScraping projects, and then call from that database to build a dynamic web application. The module and challenge this week combined multiple technologies: Python (and specifically Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and WebDriver) to author code that scrapes data from websites, MongoDB and PyMongo to push the scraped data from Python to our NoSQL database, and HTML and CSS (in combination with Flask) to construct a web application, serving as a user-friendly GUI to make use of our web scraping program.

### Purpose of Project
What is your <i>dream</i> job? For our module, our client's dream job is to work for NASA. She has endeavored to build a dynamic web application in hopes of putting together a library of data based on Mars in the hopes of attracting attention (hopefully NASA's) and land a job helping them in future missions to Mars.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Project
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>The initial challenge of the module was learning some new libraries: Beautiful Soup and Splinter. These libraries aid data scientists in automating native browsers in order to visit web pages and harvest data from them much faster than what a normal person could. There is a lot to learn here, and not just with the code, but also about the ethical nature of what we're endeavoring to do. It's important that anyone engaging in WebScraping understands what they're doing and takes reasonable precaution to ensure they're following applicable regulations and terms of service agreements.<br>
    <br>
    Additional challenges can somewhat specifically relate to working with unstructured data. Data Analysts and scientists coming from a world where most of their data is structured might have a bit of a learning curve to working with unstructured data.<br>

  </tr>

  <tr><td><p>And then finally, working with two new languages, HTML5 and CSS3, required getting used to all of the syntax, formatting, structures, and nuances of those languages. But the result is the ability to take really amazing data and share it with a <i>much</i> larger audience. To understand that ability, there are two pretty simple questions. How many people have Python3, several libraries, MongoDB, and Anaconda installed on their systems? Now, how many people have Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari installed on their computer, tablet, or phone? Our audience has quite obviously grown.<br></p></td>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Challenges and Goals
The module was <i>very</i> helpful in guiding us through the initial web application development and underlying code, but the challenge sent us out with our tools of choice into the wild. The hemisphere images, though, are incredible! What a beautiful place! NASA will definitely need some skilled, capable minds passionate about space exploration for their missions to Mars. There's a great deal of work to be done just to send the first group of brave explorers, and maybe one day the first group of people to establish a long-term settlement on another planet. How exciting!?

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I've been working pretty extensively on my Python, and I'm really starting to find my groove, so building the additional functions was really fun and I enjoyed the process.

Reading the html code on the new websites to be scraped certainly offered some challenge in really getting deeper with the code and understanding how tags and various aspects of the code work and are layered onto one another. Once I got a feel for understanding the stucture, I was able to navigate fairly well and am thankful to have begun another fork of the journey to expand on my development capabilities.
